# grammer_correct

Correct grammar is essential in any language. The role of syntax in a programming language is similar to the role of grammar in any language. I'll walk you through the grammatical correction task in Python in this article.

How do I use Python for Grammar Correction?

There are several tools that may assist you in correcting grammatical errors when writing. Grammarly is one of the greatest instances of such software. It may repair any mistakes in your writing and help you in completing your articles, emails, or any piece of writing without errors.
The Gingerit Python library is an open-source library that includes all of Grammarly's features. It is simple to install using the pip command;

pip install gingerit. 


In the above code, I import the GingerIt function from the gingerit library before saving a sentence as user input in the variable 'text'.
The GingerIt() method is then initialised on the supplied text. This method produces a dictionary containing the text and the result, thus I chose'result' to show the corrected text in the final output.
